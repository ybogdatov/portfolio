### :book: Developing a recommender system for student admission based on their studentâ€™s academic performance stated in their application using Machine Learning Algorithms
#### Project Description
This project, conducted for my MSc in Applied Data Science, focused on machine learning algorithms in the student admission domain. I performed exploratory data analysis on a graduate admission dataset and trained classification and regression models specifically for Anglia Ruskin University. The aim was to identify the most efficient algorithm for admission purposes. Additionally, I proposed a web application prototype for the university's admission office.
#### Results
